Download and install Go quickly with the steps described here.

## Linux

Remove any previous Go installation by deleting the **/usr/local/go** folder (if it exists).
```bash
 sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Download the archive to your computer [`here`](https://go.dev/dl/).

Extract the downloaded archive into **/usr/local**, which will create a new Go directory at **/usr/local/go**. 
Be sure to replace **/path/to/your/archive.tar.gz** with the actual path to your archive file.
```bash
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf /path/to/your/archive.tar.gz
```

Add **/usr/local/go/bin** to the PATH environment variable.

You can do this by adding the following line to your **$HOME/.profile** or **/etc/profile** (for a system-wide installation):

```bash
// ~/.profile
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

Changes made to a profile file may not apply until the next time you log into your computer. 
To apply the changes immediately, just run the shell commands directly or execute them from the profile using a command such as source $HOME/.profile.

```bash
source $HOME/.profile.
```

Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:
```bash
go version
```

## Mac
Download the package file to your computer [`here`](https://go.dev/dl/).

Open the package file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.

The package installs the Go distribution to **/usr/local/go**. 
The package should put the **/usr/local/go/bin** directory in your PATH environment variable. 
You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:
```bash
go version
```

## Windows
Download the MSI file to your computer [`here`](https://go.dev/dl/).

Open the MSI file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.

By default, the installer will install Go to Program Files or Program Files (x86). 
You can change the location as needed. After installing, you will need to close and reopen any open command prompts so that 
changes to the environment made by the installer are reflected at the command prompt.

Verify that you've installed Go.

In Windows, click the Start menu.

In the menu's search box, type cmd, then press the Enter key.

In the Command Prompt window that appears, type the following command:
```bash
go version
```
