import FileTree from '../../../components/file-tree.astro';

A well-organized sidebar is key to a good documentation as it is one of the main ways users will navigate your site. Starlight provides a complete set of options to customize your sidebar layout and content.

## Default sidebar

By default, Starlight will automatically generate a sidebar based on the filesystem structure of your documentation, using each file's `title` property as the sidebar entry.

For example, given the following file structure:

<FileTree>

- src/
  - content/
    - docs/
      - guides/
        - components.md
        - i18n.md
      - reference/
        - configuration.md

</FileTree>

The following sidebar will be automatically generated:

## Add links and link groups

To configure your sidebar [links](#links) and [groups of links](#groups) (within a collapsible header), use the [`starlight.sidebar`](/reference/configuration/#sidebar) property in `astro.config.mjs`.

By combining links and groups, you can create a wide variety of sidebar layouts.

### Links

Add a link to an internal or external page using an object with `label` and `link` properties.

```js "label:" "link:"
starlight({
	sidebar: [
		// A link to the CSS & Styling guide.
		{ label: 'CSS & Styling', link: '/guides/css-and-tailwind/' },
		// An external link to the Astro website.
		{ label: 'Astro', link: 'https://astro.build/' },
	],
});
```

The configuration above generates the following sidebar:

### Groups

You can add structure to your sidebar by grouping related links together under a collapsible heading.
Groups can contain both links and other sub-groups.

Add a group using an object with `label` and `items` properties.
The `label` will be used as the heading for the group.
Add links or subgroups to the `items` array.

```js /^\s*(label:|items:)/
starlight({
	sidebar: [
		// A group of links labelled "Guides".
		{
			label: 'Guides',
			items: [
				{ label: 'Components', link: '/guides/components/' },
				{ label: 'Internationalization (i18n)', link: '/guides/i18n/' },
				// A nested group of links.
				{
					label: 'Styling',
					items: [
						{ label: 'CSS', link: '/guides/css-and-tailwind/' },
						{ label: 'Tailwind', link: '/guides/css-and-tailwind/' },
						{ label: 'Shiki', link: '/guides/css-and-tailwind/' },
					],
				},
			],
		},
	],
});
```

The configuration above generates the following sidebar:

### Autogenerated groups

Starlight can automatically generate a group in your sidebar based on a directory of your docs.
This is helpful when you do not want to manually enter each sidebar item in a group.
Pages will be sorted alphabetically by filename by default.

Add an autogenerated group using an object with `label` and `autogenerate` properties. Your `autogenerate` configuration must specify the `directory` to use for sidebar entries. For example, with the following configuration:

```js "label:" "autogenerate:"
starlight({
	sidebar: [
		{
			label: 'Guides',
			// Autogenerate a group of links for the 'guides' directory.
			autogenerate: { directory: 'guides' },
		},
	],
});
```

And the following file structure:

<FileTree>

- src/
  - content/
    - docs/
      - guides/
        - components.md
        - i18n.md
        - advanced/
          - project-structure.md

</FileTree>

The following sidebar will be generated:


#### Customizing autogenerated links in frontmatter

Use the [`sidebar` frontmatter field](/reference/frontmatter/#sidebar) in individual pages to customize autogenerated links.

Sidebar frontmatter options allow you to set a [custom label](/reference/frontmatter/#label) or add a [badge](/reference/frontmatter/#badge) to a link, [hide](/reference/frontmatter/#hidden) a link from the sidebar, or define a [custom sort weighting](/reference/frontmatter/#order).

```md "sidebar:"
---
# src/content/docs/example.md
title: My page
sidebar:
  # Set a custom label for the link
  label: Custom sidebar label
  # Set a custom order for the link (lower numbers are displayed higher up)
  order: 2
  # Add a badge to the link
  badge:
    text: New
    variant: tip
---
```

An autogenerated group including a page with the frontmatter above will generate the following sidebar:

:::note
The `sidebar` frontmatter configuration is only used for autogenerated links and will be ignored for manually defined links.

## Badges

Links, groups, and autogenerated groups can also include a `badge` property to display a badge next to their label.

```js {10,17}
starlight({
	sidebar: [
		{
			label: 'Guides',
			items: [
				// A link with a "New" badge.
				{
					label: 'Components',
					link: '/guides/components/',
					badge: 'New',
				},
			],
		},
		// An autogenerated group with a "Deprecated" badge.
		{
			label: 'Reference',
			badge: 'Deprecated',
			autogenerate: { directory: 'reference' },
		},
	],
});
```

The configuration above generates the following sidebar:
