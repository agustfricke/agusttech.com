Components let you easily reuse a piece of UI or styling consistently.
Examples might include a link card or a YouTube embed.
Starlight supports the use of components in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files and provides some common components for you to use.

[Learn more about building components in the Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/).

You can use a component by importing it into your MDX file and then rendering it as a JSX tag.
These look like HTML tags but start with an uppercase letter matching the name in your `import` statement:

```mdx
